# Command Line Tools Presentation

This is the repository that contains the code, files, and slides
for the Command Line Tools presentation hosted by Galvanize, Inc.
in their Advanced Coding sessions.

## Using this repository

The different directories in this repository contain different
assets from the presentation.

* In `artwork/`, you'll find the files used to create the slides
  found in the `slides/` directory
* In `data/`, you'll find the files that were used during the
  presentation to demonstrate the tools
* In `script/`, you'll find the different command line invocations
  used during the presentation and the associated slide that would
  be shown
* In `slides/` you'll find the images used during the presentation

## Tools used in the presentation

* [**bat**](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat), a nice replacement for
  `cat` that has line numbers, syntax highlighting, git-monitored
  modifications, and integration with other tools, like `tail` and `fzf`
* [**gawk**](www.gnu.org/software/gawk/), one of those programs that
  processes text files with a weird scripting language that allows you to
  basically do anything, but usually would want to do it with something
  like Python or Rust, but is really good for plucking out portions of
  content from lines of text
* [**GNU coreutils**](https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils), a
  set of invaluable command line utilities like `base64`, `pr`,
  `head`, `tail`, `wc`, `md5sum`, `sort`, `uniq`, `tr`, `expand`,
  and all of the file system utilities that you'd expect on a *nix
  system
* [**GNU findutils**](https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils), another
  set of tools for finding files and executing command lines, containing
  `find`, `locate`, and `xargs`
* [**jq**](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/), a happy utility for working
  with JSON on the command line
* [**kitty**](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty), a favored
  terminal emulator for *nixes
* [**lynx**](https://invisible-island.net/lynx/), a command-line Web
  browser
* [**sed**](https://www.gnu.org/software/sed/), a "stream" editor for
  modifying files line by line rather than in a buffered window

## Tools used in making the presentation

* [**Affinity Designer**](https://affinity.serif.com/designer/), an
  affordable and powerful vector editing application
* [**figlet**](http://www.figlet.org), a way to make ASCII art
* [**gcc**](https://gcc.gnu.org/), a libre open-source C (and many other
  languages) compiler
* [**GNU Make**](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/), a tool to manage
  software compilation
* [**lolcat**](https://github.com/busyloop/lolcat), a way to pretty up
  your text output
* [**neovim**](https://neovim.io), a continuation and extension
  of `vim`, the improvement over Bill Joy's `vi`, not because I am an
  avid user of the `vi` family of editors (I'm originally an `emacs`
  user), but because I'm trying to remain open minded about command-line
  text editors.
